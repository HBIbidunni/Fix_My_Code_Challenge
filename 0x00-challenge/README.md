# ALX Project: Fix my code challenge :bulb:
----------
This is a unique and new type of project where we will jump into an existing code base and fix it!

Sometimes the language is known, sometimes not.

The codes whose implementations need to be corrected or fixed are in the languages of:
- __Python__
- __Javascript__
- __Ruby__
- __C__


> All comments, feedbacks and suggestions are highly welcome. Kindly take a look at my
codes to get an insight. Scroll up :arrow_up:, please.
